### What is StudyLens?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
StudyLens was created to tackle the challenge of navigating the overwhelming abundance of learning resources in data science and its related fields. Our aim is to curate high-quality, relevant materials, enriching them with the context and metadata necessary for a truly effective learning experience. 

We're here to streamline your educational journey, ensuring that every resource you encounter through StudyLens is not just informative but perfectly aligned with your learning goals and expertise level.


### Where do we get our data from?
We are always trying to add more data providers into our collection for more context and data enrichment, however, currently these are the data providers we are actively working with.
